# REACT-Webpack-components
Not using CRA(create-react-app libarary) I configured each webpack settings and made react components   
( 'modal', 'tooltip', 'carousel', 'navbar', 'drag-and-drop', 'card', 'sidebar', 'tabs' )   
After finishing this project, I could understand what is webpack and how to use webpack, furthermore how to structure react component.   
Also, this web-site is responsive.
